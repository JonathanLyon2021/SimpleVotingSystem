# SimpleVotingSystem
This is Exercise 12 from MI4 in Kingsland Universities Blockchain Developer Program.

# Goals
You will build a voting application where you will initialize a set of candidates who will be contesting in the election
and then vote for the candidates. The votes will be stored on the blockchain. You will go through the process of
implementing the voting contract, deploying to the local test blockchain, and interacting with the contract methods.
